### Step 2: Add to MainActivity Navigation

Add a "Settings" button on main screen that navigates to SettingsScreen

### Step 3: Implement Open Source Licenses (Easy Way)

Add to `app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.android.gms.oss-licenses-plugin")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-oss-licenses:17.1.0")
}
```

Then add to project-level `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.android.gms.oss-licenses-plugin") version "0.10.6" apply false
}
```

This auto-generates a screen with all licenses!
